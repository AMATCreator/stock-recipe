      <p>Tip: For a better result, heat up the ingredients like onion, garlic, carrot, tomatoes, tomato paste and red beet in a frying pan before adding them to the soup, this will prevent your soup from cooling down every time you a dd new ingredient.</p>
      <p>Tip: Make sure you skeem the foam of the surface regularly to ensure your broth will be as clear as possible. This also removes the guck and gelatine substance that float up from your meat that would otherwise cloud your broth and influence the taste.</p>
