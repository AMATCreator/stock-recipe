      <ul>
        <li>Beef bones, with meat (or shank of beef) if you will cook the soup right after</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>4 Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Carrot</li>
        <li>3 Celery stems</li>
        <li>1 leek (green part)</li>
        <li>2 Bay leafs</li>
        <li>7l Water</li>
        <li>dried herbs:1tbsp whole Peppercorns, 1tbsp coriander seeds, 2tbsp marjoram, 2tbsp chervil (you can put the herbs in 1 or 2 teabags for convenience)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of water (approximately 7l) to a boil, lightly salted. </li>
        <li>Wash the meat and the bones and add them to the boiling water. Let it softly boil for about 4 hours. Remove the floating guck and foam regularly.</li>
        <li>Take out the meat and put aside to cool. Sift the stock through a cheese cloth into another pot, repeat this process 2 or three times untill the stock is clear.</li>
        <li>Put the stock again to boil and add the rest of the ingredients and let the whole simmer for 2 or 3 more hours. You will notice that the liquid is reduced, a reduction of 1/3 is good, 1/2 is also ok, if it has reduced more, you can add water later. Don't forget to skim the surface regularly to keep the stock clear.</li>
        <li>Take out the vergetables and herbs, then sift the stock through a cheese cloth in another pot. Repeat the process 2 or 3 times until the stock is as clear as possible.</li>
        <li>Now you stock is ready to use. You can directly use the stock to start cooking your delicious borsch or you can freeze the stock in batches to use later.</li>
      </ol>
